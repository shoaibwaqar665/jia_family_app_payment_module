# ✅ Errors Fixed

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Duplicate File Error
**Problem:**
```
internal/app/app.simple.go:18:6: App redeclared in this block
internal/app/app.go:18:6: other declaration of App
```

**Cause:** The `app.simple.go` file was still present after we copied its contents to `app.go`, causing duplicate declarations.

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate `app.simple.go` file
```bash
rm internal/app/app.simple.go
```

### 2. Duplicate Directory Structure
**Problem:**
```
github.com/jia-app/paymentservice/api/payment/v1/payment_service_grpc.pb.go:19:16: 
undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion9
```

**Cause:** There was a nested `github.com/` directory inside the project root that contained duplicate/outdated generated code.

**Fix:** Removed the entire duplicate directory structure
```bash
rm -rf github.com/
```
