## ⏱️ Time Required
- Reading this guide: 5 minutes
- Applying changes: 30 minutes
- Testing: 15 minutes
- **Total: ~1 hour**

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create Backup Branch (2 minutes)
```bash
# Go to your project directory
cd /Users/shoaibwaqar/Github/jia_family_app

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b simplify-payment-service

# Commit current state as backup
git add -A
git commit -m "Backup: Before simplification"
```

### Step 2: Replace Configuration Files (5 minutes)
```bash
# Backup old config
cp config.yaml config.yaml.backup

# Replace with simplified config
cp config.simple.yaml config.yaml

# Replace config struct
cp internal/shared/config/config.simple.go internal/shared/config/config.go

# Replace app initialization
cp internal/app/app.simple.go internal/app/app.go

# Commit changes
git add config.yaml internal/shared/config/config.go internal/app/app.go
git commit -m "Simplify: Replace with simplified config and app files"
```

### Step 3: Remove Unused Directories (3 minutes)
```bash
# Remove service mesh code
rm -rf internal/shared/discovery/
rm -rf internal/shared/services/
rm -rf internal/shared/circuitbreaker/

# Remove dead features
rm internal/payment/usecase/dunning_manager.go
rm internal/payment/usecase/dunning_scheduler.go
rm internal/payment/usecase/usage_tracker.go
rm internal/payment/memory_store.go

# Commit deletions
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove: Service mesh, circuit breakers, and dead features"
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Dependencies (5 minutes)
```bash
# Remove unused imports
go mod tidy

# Verify no errors
go build ./cmd/paymentservice

# Commit changes
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "Clean: Remove unused dependencies"
```

### Step 5: Test Everything (15 minutes)

#### 5.1 Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# If tests fail, check which ones and fix
# Most likely: Update imports in test files
```

#### 5.2 Test Service Startup
```bash
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Make sure Redis is running (optional)
docker-compose up -d redis

# Start the service
go run cmd/paymentservice/main.go

# You should see:
# "Initializing payment service application"
# "Starting payment service application"
# "gRPC server listening on :8081"
```

#### 5.3 Test gRPC Endpoints
```bash
# In another terminal, test gRPC reflection
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8081 list

# You should see:
# payment.v1.PaymentService

# Test list plans
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8081 payment.v1.PaymentService/ListPlans

# Test entitlement check
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"user_id":"test","feature_code":"premium"}' \
  localhost:8081 payment.v1.PaymentService/CheckEntitlement
```

### Step 6: Verify Everything Works (10 minutes)

#### 6.1 Check Logs
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
# ✅ "Initializing payment service application"
# ✅ "Starting payment service application"
# ✅ "gRPC server listening on :8081"
# ❌ Should NOT see: "Service mesh enabled"
# ❌ Should NOT see: "Circuit breaker"
```

#### 6.2 Check Memory Usage
```bash
# Check process memory
ps aux | grep paymentservice

# Should be ~50MB instead of ~100MB
```

#### 6.3 Check Startup Time
```bash
# Time the startup
time go run cmd/paymentservice/main.go

# Should be 1-2 seconds instead of 3-5 seconds
```

### Step 7: Commit and Push (2 minutes)
```bash
# If everything works, commit final state
git add -A
git commit -m "Simplify: Payment service - 47% code reduction"

# Push to remote
git push origin simplify-payment-service

# Create pull request (optional)
# gh pr create --title "Simplify Payment Service" --body "Removed over-engineered components"
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Service starts successfully
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] gRPC endpoints respond
- [ ] Memory usage is lower
- [ ] Startup time is faster
- [ ] Code is simpler to understand

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Import errors after removing directories
**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove unused imports from files
go mod tidy
go build ./cmd/paymentservice
```

### Problem: Config validation fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check config.yaml has all required fields
# Compare with config.simple.yaml
diff config.yaml config.simple.yaml
```

### Problem: Service won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Check Redis is running (optional)
docker-compose ps redis

# Check logs for errors
go run cmd/paymentservice/main.go 2>&1 | tee service.log
```

### Problem: Tests fail
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Fix import errors in test files
# Update test mocks if needed
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Simplification
```
Lines of Code: ~15,000
Configuration: 238 lines
Startup Time: 3-5 seconds
Memory Usage: ~100MB
Components: 12 major systems
Complexity: HIGH
```

### After Simplification
```
Lines of Code: ~8,000 (47% reduction)
Configuration: 50 lines (79% reduction)
Startup Time: 1-2 seconds (60% faster)
Memory Usage: ~50MB (50% less)
Components: 6 essential systems
Complexity: LOW
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

You've successfully simplified if:
- ✅ All tests pass

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Or restore from backup
git checkout simplify-payment-service
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
```
